Develop a systems engineering plan for a realistic project.

Project Deliverables
--------------------

The project deliverables comprise 40% of the final grade for this course.

*   Individual Project proposal (presentation and 1-page description) — 10%
*   Mid-term team presentation — 10%
*   Final team presentation — 20%

Detailed Overview
-----------------

During Ses #3, each student will have 2 minutes to present a project proposal. After viewing all of the proposals, students need to form teams of 3-5. Each team must have the project idea originator. A team formation report (a one page report containing names of the team members and project idea) must be submitted by Ses #5.

Your team will make an 8-minute mid-term progress presentation during Ses #9. In this presentation, you will need to include (but are not limited to) the following topics:

*   Project definition / problem statement
*   Project scope
*   Stakeholders and their needs
*   System requirements
*   Your planned approaches
*   Challenges and issues that you face

During the final two sessions, your team will make a 20-minute final presentation on your project. In the final presentation, you should include (but are not limited to) the following topics:

*   Problem definition
*   Project scope
*   Stakeholders and their needs
*   Approaches you took
    *   System Engineering methods and tools used
    *   Different concepts you generated
    *   Concept selection process
*   Final recommendation
*   Reflection on what your team have learned about systems thinking
